Their headquarters are located in Fairfield Ohio, yet they have a contracted building on campus that they allow interns to use. My current title there is IT Tester, which in short means they hired me to break the system. My day-to-day is running test cases and testing different software to insure that they are running properly. If not I have to document in detail what the problem is. I have been working with Cincinnati Insurance Group since August 2021. I also am currently the youngest intern they have hired to date.</p>

At Graphic Village my title was Computer Technical Support Intern. At Graphic Village my job was to be the very first point of contact for anyone that was having issues related to computers, phones, printers, or any kind of other technical error. I was then tasked with solving that problem promptly then documenting what the problem was and how it was solved. I was also the youngest intern they have hired to date. I worked there as a summer internship from May to August of 2021.</p>

The building had just opened in 2018 and I was one of the very first crew members to work there. I became the youngest ever in Raising Canes history to achieve my Crew Traner Certification which is the highest level next to the manager. For two years I mentored new employees, ensured quality food was being served as well as quality customer service was happening. To this day I still hold the record for fastest drive-thru times in a day at 1 minute and 16 seconds per car. I worked there from November 2018 to November 2020. </p>
